# Portfolio

This is an app built in Rails to showcase the projects I have built.  
It is currently hosted at <https://portfolio.southball.dev>.

## Data

The data is located at [db/seeds.rb](https://github.com/southball/portfolio-rails/blob/main/db/seeds.rb), and the database is reset and the seed script run every time there is a push to the `main` branch.  
The icons and screenshots are placed in [app/assets/images/](https://github.com/southball/portfolio-rails/tree/main/app/assets/images).
